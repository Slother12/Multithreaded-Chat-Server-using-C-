# Multithreaded-Chat-Server-using-C-
Multithreaded Chat Server using C++ Socket Programming – A client–server chat system with multithreading, supporting real-time private and group communication.

# Multithreaded Chat Server (C++ Sockets)

This is a **self project** where I built a multithreaded chat server using **C++ socket programming**.  
The project simulates a real-time chat application with multiple clients connected to a server, exchanging messages simultaneously.  
It was developed to strengthen my understanding of **networking, concurrency, and system programming**.

##  What the Project Does

- **Client–Server Communication** → Implements TCP sockets for reliable message transfer between clients and server.  
- **Multithreaded Server** → Uses threads to handle multiple client connections at the same time.  
- **Messaging Features** → Supports private messages, group chat, and broadcast functionality.  
- **Fault Tolerance** → Handles unexpected client disconnections gracefully without crashing the server.  
- **Learning Outcome** → Enhanced skills in socket programming, concurrency, and real-time communication systems.

## Features

- Concurrent client connections with thread-based handling  
- Real-time private and group messaging  
- Message broadcasting to all connected clients  
- Basic client authentication and session management  
- Error handling for stable server operation

## Future Improvements

- Add **end-to-end encryption** for secure messaging  
- Implement **file sharing support** between clients  
- Build a simple **GUI client** (using Qt or JavaFX) for better usability  
- Add **user roles and chat rooms** for structured conversations  
- Deploy on a cloud server for remote accessibility
